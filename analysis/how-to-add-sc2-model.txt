1. Create a script that trains a model, using yasin/beatAMLdreamChallenge/beatAML_SC2-no-PC5.R as a template.
This stores the trained model in an rds file.

2. Add the model to the script yasin/beatAMLdreamChallenge/beatAML_pred_SC2_all_models.R (to the models variable) and also calculate any
dependent variables (e.g., a signature) from the validation data.

3. Run the script beatAML_pred_SC2_all_models.R, which will run all models <model.name> listed
in the models variable and will output the responses of the model as applied to the validation data
<model.name>_predictions_response.csv

4. Add the model to analysis/plot-sc2.R (to the models variable)

5. Run analysis/plot-sc2.R
